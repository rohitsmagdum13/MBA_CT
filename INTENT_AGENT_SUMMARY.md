|-------------|-------|---------|
| `member_verification` | MemberVerificationAgent | Verify member eligibility and status |
| `deductible_oop` | DeductibleOOPAgent | Query deductible and OOP information |
| `benefit_accumulator` | BenefitAccumulatorAgent | Check service usage and benefit limits |

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

The agent is already integrated into the MBA system. No additional installation needed.

### Basic Usage

```python
from MBA.agents import IntentIdentificationAgent

# Initialize agent
agent = IntentIdentificationAgent()

# Classify a query
result = await agent.identify("Is member M1001 active?")

print(result["intent"])           # "member_verification"
print(result["confidence"])       # 0.95
print(result["suggested_agent"])  # "MemberVerificationAgent"
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
python test_intent_agent.py
```

---

  "success": true,
  "intent": "benefit_accumulator",

}
```

## 🔧 Integration Pattern

### Intelligent Query Routing

```python
async def route_query(user_query: str):
    """Route user query to appropriate agent based on intent."""

    # Step 1: Identify intent
    intent_agent = IntentIdentificationAgent()
    result = await intent_agent.identify(user_query)

    if not result["success"]:
        return {"error": "Could not understand query"}

    # Step 2: Extract information
    intent = result["intent"]
    entities = result["extracted_entities"]
    confidence = result["confidence"]

    # Step 3: Route to appropriate agent
    if intent == "member_verification":
        from MBA.agents import MemberVerificationAgent
        agent = MemberVerificationAgent()
        return await agent.verify_member(
            member_id=entities.get("member_id")
        )

    elif intent == "deductible_oop":
        from MBA.agents import DeductibleOOPAgent
        agent = DeductibleOOPAgent()
        return await agent.get_deductible_oop(
            member_id=entities.get("member_id")
        )

    elif intent == "benefit_accumulator":
        from MBA.agents import BenefitAccumulatorAgent
        agent = BenefitAccumulatorAgent()
        return await agent.get_benefit_accumulator(
            member_id=entities.get("member_id")
        )

    elif intent == "benefit_coverage_rag":
        from MBA.agents import BenefitCoverageRAGAgent
        agent = BenefitCoverageRAGAgent()
        return await agent.query(question=user_query)

    elif intent == "local_rag":
        from MBA.agents import LocalRAGAgent
        agent = LocalRAGAgent()
        return await agent.query(question=user_query)

    else:  # general_inquiry
        return {
            "message": "How can I help you today? I can assist with member verification, benefit inquiries, and more."
        }
```

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Expected Performance

When you run `test_intent_agent.py`, you should see results like:

```
TESTING MEMBER_VERIFICATION
─────────────────────────────────────────────
✓ Test 1/5: Is member M1001 active?
  Intent: member_verification
  Confidence: 0.95
  Extracted: member_id=M1001, query_type=status

✓ Test 2/5: Check eligibility for member M5678
  Intent: member_verification
  Confidence: 0.90
  ...

Accuracy for member_verification: 5/5 (100%)
```

### Overall Expected Accuracy

- **Member Verification**: ~95-100%
- **Deductible/OOP**: ~90-95%
- **Benefit Accumulator**: ~95-100%
- **Benefit Coverage RAG**: ~85-95%
- **Local RAG**: ~90-100%
- **General Inquiry**: ~95-100%

**Overall Accuracy**: Should be **90%+** for properly formatted queries

## 🎨 Key Features

### 1. Pattern-Based Pre-Classification
- Fast regex matching (< 10ms)
- No API calls for simple queries
- Fallback to LLM for complex cases

### 2. Entity Extraction
- **Member IDs**: Extracts M followed by 3+ digits
- **Service Types**: Identifies 20+ common services
- **Query Types**: Classifies as status/coverage/usage/financial

### 3. Confidence Scoring
- Pattern match counting
- Multi-factor scoring algorithm
- Clear confidence levels (High/Medium/Low)

### 4. Fallback Handling
- Suggests alternative intent if primary fails
- Graceful degradation
- Never returns errors for valid queries

### 5. Batch Processing
- Process multiple queries efficiently
- Shared context across queries
- Useful for conversation analysis

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key_here
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_here
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
BEDROCK_MODEL_ID=anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0
```

### Model Settings

The agent uses **Claude Sonnet 4.5** via AWS Bedrock for complex classification tasks, but relies primarily on pattern matching for speed.
