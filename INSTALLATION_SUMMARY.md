# 📦 Local RAG Installation Summary

## ✅ Current Status

### Python Dependencies - **INSTALLED**
All Python packages for Local RAG are already installed in your project's virtual environment:

- ✅ **pymupdf** (1.26.5) - PDF text extraction
- ✅ **tabula-py** (2.10.0) - PDF table extraction
- ✅ **pdfplumber** (0.11.7) - Alternative PDF processing
- ✅ **sentence-transformers** (5.1.1) - Local embeddings
- ✅ **chromadb** (1.1.1) - Local vector database

### Java - **NOT INSTALLED**
❌ Java is required for Tabula (table extraction from PDFs)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Install Java

You have **3 options**:

#### **Option A: Using Chocolatey (Recommended)**
Open **PowerShell as Administrator** and run:
```powershell
choco install openjdk
```

#### **Option B: Using our installation script**
Open **PowerShell as Administrator** and run:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\ROHIT\Work\HMA\MBA_CT
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
.\install_java.ps1
```

#### **Option C: Manual Installation**
1. Download from: https://adoptium.net/
2. Run the installer
3. Restart your terminal

---

### Step 2: Verify Installation

After installing Java and restarting your terminal:

```bash
# Check Java is installed
java -version

# Start the Streamlit app
uv run mba-app
```

---

## 🧪 Test Without Java (Optional)

You can test the Local RAG interface without Java (table extraction will be limited):

1. **Start Streamlit:**
   ```bash
   uv run mba-app
   ```

2. **Navigate to "Local RAG" tab** (Tab 10)

3. The app will work for text extraction, but Tabula table extraction will fail gracefully

## 📝 What You Can Do Right Now

### ✅ Available (No Java Required):
- Text extraction from PDFs (PyMuPDF)
- Embeddings generation (Sentence Transformers)
- Vector storage (ChromaDB)
- Reranking (Cross-Encoder)
- Query answering (AWS Bedrock Claude)

### ⏸️ Requires Java:
- Table extraction from PDFs (Tabula)
- Complete structured data extraction

---

## 🎯 Full Workflow After Java Installation

### 1. Upload PDF
- Navigate to "Local RAG" tab
- Select "Upload PDF" mode
- Upload `benefit_coverage.pdf`
- Click "Extract Content"
- ✅ Extracts text (PyMuPDF) + tables (Tabula)

### 2. Prepare Pipeline
- Switch to "Prepare Pipeline" mode
- Select extracted JSON file
- Click "Prepare Pipeline"
- ✅ Generates embeddings and stores in ChromaDB

### 3. Query Documents
- Switch to "Query Documents" mode
- Enter question: "Is massage therapy covered?"
- Click "Query"
- ✅ Receive AI-generated answer with source citations

---

## 🔍 Example Queries for benefit_coverage.pdf

Try these after setup:

1. **"Is massage therapy covered?"**
2. **"What is the deductible?"**
3. **"What services require preauthorization?"**
4. **"Is acupuncture covered and what are the limits?"**
5. **"What is the emergency room copay?"**
6. **"Are preventive services covered at 100%?"**
7. **"What is the hearing aid benefit?"**
8. **"What mental health benefits are available?"**
9. **"Which services have the deductible waived?"**
10. **"What is the out-of-pocket maximum?"**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Java not found" error when extracting tables
**Solution:** Install Java using one of the methods in Step 1 above

### Streamlit shows import errors
**Solution:** Make sure you're using `uv run mba-app` (not plain `streamlit run`)

### "Local RAG" tab not visible
**Solution:**
1. Stop the app (Ctrl+C)
2. Restart: `uv run mba-app`
3. Look for Tab 10 (rightmost tab)

### Models downloading slowly
**First-time only:** Two AI models will download (~170 MB total):
- Sentence Transformer: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (~90 MB)
- Cross-Encoder: ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2 (~80 MB)

These are cached locally and only downloaded once.

## 📊 System Requirements

✅ **You Have:**
- Python 3.13.5
- All Python packages installed
- Virtual environment set up

⏳ **You Need:**
- Java 8+ (for table extraction)

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Without Java
If you skip Java installation, the system will still work but:
- ✅ Text extraction works fine
- ❌ Table extraction will fail
- ✅ You can still query text content

### With Java
Full functionality:
- ✅ Complete text extraction
- ✅ Structured table extraction
- ✅ Optimal document understanding
- ✅ Better query accuracy

---

## 📞 Next Steps

### Immediate (No Java):
```bash
uv run mba-app
```
Navigate to "Local RAG" tab and explore the interface

### After Java Installation:
```bash
java -version  # Verify Java is installed
uv run mba-app  # Start app with full functionality
```

Upload a PDF and test the complete workflow!
