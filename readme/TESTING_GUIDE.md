# Orchestration Agent Testing Guide

Complete guide for testing the orchestration agent with all available tools and test queries.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Interactive Testing (Recommended for Manual Testing)
```bash
python interactive_orchestration_test.py
```

Interactive console where you can:
- Type queries one at a time
- See formatted results instantly
- View examples with `examples` command
- Toggle JSON output with `json` command
- Type `quit` to exit

### 2. Quick Test (5 queries, one per intent)
```bash
python test_all_orchestration_queries.py --quick
```

Tests one query from each intent type:
- Member Verification
- Deductible/OOP
- Benefit Accumulator
- Benefit Coverage RAG
- General Inquiry

### 3. Full Test Suite (100+ queries)
```bash
python test_all_orchestration_queries.py
```

Comprehensive test with:
- All query types and variations
- Edge cases and error handling
- Detailed results saved to `orchestration_test_results.json`
- Summary statistics and breakdowns

### 4. Single Query Test
```bash
python test_orchestration_fix.py
```

Simple test with one hardcoded query to verify the fix works.

## üéØ Testing Methods

### Method 1: Interactive Console

**Best for:** Manual exploration and debugging

```bash
python interactive_orchestration_test.py
```

**Features:**
- Real-time query testing
- Formatted output
- Command support (`examples`, `history`, `json`)
- Easy to use

**Example Session:**
```
>>> Is member M1001 active?
‚è≥ Processing: Is member M1001 active?...

## üîç Debugging Failed Tests

If a test fails, check:

1. **Logs**: Look for detailed logs showing tool execution
   ```
   Tool #1: analyze_query
   Tool #2: route_to_agent
   ```

2. **Intent Classification**: Was the intent correctly identified?
   - Check confidence score
   - Review reasoning field

3. **Entity Extraction**: Were entities properly extracted?
   - Check extracted_entities field
   - Verify member IDs, service types

4. **Agent Execution**: Did the specialized agent run?
   - Check agent field
   - Look for agent-specific logs

5. **Error Messages**: What error was returned?
   - Missing member ID?
   - Database issue?
   - Invalid parameters?
